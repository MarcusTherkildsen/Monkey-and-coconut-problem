Monkeys and coconuts on the original gameboy

The goal is to recreate the monkey and coconut solution in assembler for the original gameboy. 

Goals
1) Create "hello world" (3/4 - 6/4)
2) Create for loops
3) Do simple + calculations
4) Figure out the break statement in loops
5) Modulo operator in assembler
6) Create the full program
7) Create some dials to input the number of original sailors and monkeys

8) Super extra stuff.
Since our compiled code won't run on a real gameboy unless the Nintendo logo is intact do the next best thing. 

After the Nintendo logo comes down and says "ding", immediately change the logo to "Monkeys and coconuts" or something
